## üéØ Why Chain-Fox

Security is the biggest concern for blockchain and smart contract users and developers.
But a manual audit is time-consuming and expensive.
Thus we establish **Chain-Fox**, 
an *all-in-one* platform with automatic security detection ability, making the security capabilities of blockchain more democratic. 
We aim to make security *affordable* to every user and developer in the blockchain ecosystem.

## üîç Checkers Supported

Checkers can be divided by languages and detection methods.

For now we are supporting 14 cutting-edge checkers. Deploying them to your working CI is non-trivial. We also have other 8 checkers that are easily integrated into CI. For these 8 checkers, a sophisticated guide of deploying them is coming soon.

According to a recent survey, most blockchain-related projects are implemented in Rust, Go, Solidity, and C++. Thus we focus on these languages. Besides them, more recent languages (like Move) are to be added.

We are also planning to add more checkers see [here](https://github.com/Chain-Fox/Awesome-Rust-Checker).

| Checker | Categories | Detected Bug Types |
| ------- | ---------- | --------|
| lockbud | rust, static | Memory & Concurrency bugs
| rudra   | rust, static |  Memory safety when panicked, Higher Order Invariant, Send Sync Variance, Lifetime Annotation Bugs |
| RAPx | rust, static | Use-After-Free, Double-Free, Memory Leaks | 
| AtomVChecker | rust, static | Atomic concurrency bugs and performance loss due to memory ordering misuse |
| Cocoon | rust, static | Secrecy Leaks |
| MIRAI | rust, static | Panic, Security bugs, Correctness |
| ERASan | rust, dynamic | Memory access bugs |
| shuttle | rust, dynamic | Concurrency bugs |
| kani | rust, verifier | Memory safety, User-specified assertions, Panics, Unexpected behavior (e.g., arithmetic overflows) |
| GCatch | go, static | Concurrency bugs |
| GFuzz | go, dynamic | Concurrency bugs |
| cppcheck | C/C++, static | Common C/C++ bugs |
| slither | solidity, static | Common Solidity bugs |
| PeCatch | solidity, static | Gas-fee bugs | 

## üêõ Bugs Found

200+ bugs are found, reported, and fixed by the checkers
