## 🎯 Why Chain-Fox

Security is the biggest concern for blockchain and smart contract users and developers.
But a manual audit is time-consuming and expensive.
Thus we establish **Chain-Fox**, 
an *all-in-one* platform with automatic security detection ability, making the security capabilities of blockchain more democratic. 
We aim to make security *affordable* to every user and developer in the blockchain ecosystem.

## 🔍 Checkers Supported

Checkers can be divided by languages and detection methods.

For now we are supporting 14 cutting-edge checkers. Deploying them to your working CI is non-trivial. We also have other 8 checkers that are easily integrated into CI. For these 8 checkers, a sophisticated guide of deploying them is coming soon.

According to a recent survey, most blockchain-related projects are implemented in Rust, Go, Solidity, and C++. Thus we focus on these languages. Besides them, more recent languages (like Move) are to be added.

We are also planning to add more checkers see [here](https://github.com/Chain-Fox/Awesome-Rust-Checker).

| AtomVChecker | rust, static | Atomic concurrency bugs and performance loss due to memory ordering misuse |
| Cocoon | rust, static | Secrecy Leaks |
| MIRAI | rust, static | Panic, Security bugs, Correctness |
| ERASan | rust, dynamic | Memory access bugs |
| shuttle | rust, dynamic | Concurrency bugs |
| kani | rust, verifier | Memory safety, User-specified assertions, Panics, Unexpected behavior (e.g., arithmetic overflows) |
